In this homework we are trying to see what the correlation between the latitude and weather is.
We got the data from the open weather maps web base and downloaded the latitude, temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed for 500 random cities.

From the temperate graph we can see that cities between the latitudes -20 to +40 have a higher temperature than other cities.

From the humidity graph we can see that humidity is average in all parts but it is lowest between latitudes 15 to 40

The cloudiness graph is showing that there are more clouds between the latitudes -20 and 20, and 60-80 than in other parts of the world.

The wind speed graph is showing some more powerful winds between the latitudes -40 and -20, and 40 to 60.

This project was done for one day and limited to little bit over 500 cities.  
In order to make any meaningful conclusion we will need much more weather data and include more cities.
